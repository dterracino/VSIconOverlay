# Visual Studio Icon Overlay
Small Visual Studio extension that adds an icon overlay with the current version.

The package in this extension is triggered when Visual Studio is loaded in design mode; it uses the taskbar icon overlay feature in Windows 7 to add the current Visual Studio version number to the icon. 

Right now, this only works on Visual Studio 2015; if it seems useful, I'll backport it to support older releases. Or someone else can submit me a pull request or fork the code :)
